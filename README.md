🎯 CodSoft Internship – Task 4 Completed

🎬 Content-Based Movie Recommendation System using Python.

As part of Task 4 in my CodSoft Internship, I developed a Content-Based Movie Recommender System using TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity.

This system recommends similar movies based on their plot descriptions, making use of natural language processing to understand text similarity.

🛠 Technologies Used

🐍 Python

📚 Pandas

🧠 Scikit-learn (TfidfVectorizer, cosine_similarity)

💡 NLP concepts: TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity

💡 Project Overview

1.Each movie is described using a plot summary.

2.Descriptions are vectorized using TF-IDF to give weight to important terms.

3.Cosine similarity is computed to find how closely movies are related based on description.

4.The system recommends top 5 similar movies to the input movie.

🧾 Sample Output

If user searches for: Inception

Recommended movies:
Interstellar  
The Matrix  
Doctor Strange  
The Dark Knight  
The Prestige

🧠 Key Concepts Learned

-Text vectorization with TF-IDF

-Similarity scoring using cosine distance

-Building a recommendation system without needing user ratings

-Basic NLP and recommender system design
